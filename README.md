# Odin-TicTacToe

A simple vanilla js tic-tac-toe game made as an assignment of The Odin Project.

The goal here is to have as little global code as possible by tucking it inside factories & using IIFE (module pattern) so it cannot be reused to create additional instances.

Console version live now while I'm working on UI.

To play, call `game.playRound(row, column)` where row & column = `0 to 2` left to right & up to down accordingly.
